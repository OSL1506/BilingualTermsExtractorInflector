            "1. Extract bilingual terms from the provided bilingual document into a CSV-formatted table with the following columns:"
            "- English term"
            "- Term Language (default value: ENGLISH)"
            "- Number (singular/plural)"
            "- Gender (default value: neutral)"
            "- POS (NOUN/ADJ/VERB)"
            "- Editable by terminologist (default value: TRUE)"
            "- Translatable (default value: TRUE)"
            "- Description (leave blank)"
            "- German translation"
            "2. Extract both nouns and adjectives. Identify the word type of each term as either noun or adjective"
            "3. Extract compound words (e.g., ‚Äòtax reduction measures‚Äô) as well as single words."
            "4. For nouns and adjectives, generate inflections:"
            "- if a singular form is extracted, also add its plural in a separate row right below the respective extracted term."
            "- if a plural form is extracted, also add its singular in a separate row right below the respective extracted term."
            "5. For nouns, also generate genitive forms:"
            "- add singular genitive form in a separate row right below the respective extracted term."
            "- add plural genitive form in a separate row right below the respective extracted term."
            "- Example: you extracted the term 'company', then generate the singular genitive ' company's ' and plural genitive ' companies' " 
            "6. Doublecheck that each term and its number are correct."
            "Example: if extracted term ‚Äòwindow‚Äô is labeled as 'Plural', change term to its actual plural form ‚Äòwindows‚Äô."
            "7. For terms with alternative spellings, generate all possible alternative spellings for them by adding a line below the respective extracted term."
            "Example: you extracted the term ‚Äòchargeoff‚Äô, it has the alternative spelling ‚Äòcharge-off‚Äô, so you should also generate ‚Äòcharge-off‚Äô in a separate row below the original term."
